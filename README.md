# HTML Multi-Video Viewing

This is an HTML page capable of toggling between up to 6 videos. Switching between different videos will maintain the timestamp.

Videos should be stored in the folder videos and named in the following format: `video1.MP4`. There should be 6 videos total. Ideally, they would be the same length, but this interface works fine otherwise as well.
