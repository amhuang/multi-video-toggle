# HTML Multi-Video Viewing

This is an HTML page capable of toggling between up to 6 videos and viewing height data provided by a JSON file. Switching between different videos will maintain the timestamp of the previous video.

Height and time data downloaded from the operation UI should be put in the main directory with `index.html` and should be named `height.json`. Videos should be stored in the folder videos and named in the following format: `video1.MP4`, `video2.MP4`, etc. There should be 6 videos total. Ideally, they would be the same length, but this interface works fine otherwise as well.
